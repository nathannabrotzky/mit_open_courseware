"""
Assume 3 variables are already defined for you: a, b, and c.
Create a variable called total that adds a and b then multiplies
the result by c. Include a last line in your code to print the
value: print(total)
"""

#This is assumed, but defining for debugging
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

# Start of finger exercise code
total = (a + b) * c
print(total)
