Computers can be annoyingly literal. If you don’t tell them exactly what you want them to do, they are likely to do the wrong thing. Try writing
an algorithm for driving between two destinations. Write it the way you would
for a person, and then imagine what would happen if that person were as stupid
as a computer, and executed the algorithm exactly as written. How many traffic
tickets might that person get?

Let's do something simple and local: Utah State Capitol to 3rd District Courthouse

Head south toward Philo T. Farnsworth Promenade
Wait 259 ft
Turn right onto E Capitol St
Wait 0.1 mi
Continue straight onto 300 N/E 3rd N
Wait 390 ft
At the traffice circle, take the 2nd exit
Wait 184 ft
Continue onto N State St
Wait 1.1 mi
Stop
Destination will be on the right

I can see many problems with this for a computer
No speeds mentioned
No traffic rules followed
No collision detection
No adjustment for weather
No detection of possible road closures (construction is a local problem here)

And probably more problems that I haven't even thought of
