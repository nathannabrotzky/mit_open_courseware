**Nathan's MIT OpenCourseware Learning**

This is a repository dedicated towards projects completed during my time reading through the materials found at MIT OpenCourseware site, https://ocw.mit.edu/.

***File Structure***

The file structure follows the same structure as the lectures, following their MIT Course #.

Currently, here are the folders present:
- 6.100L (a.k.a. 6.100A, 6.0001): Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/
- 6.0002: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
- 6.001: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Additionally, there is a separate folder called "Language Backtraces".
This folder contains projects divided by languages that complete projects from courses not designed for that language.
Structure of this is as follows:
Language Backtraces
>> Language Folders (i.e. Python, Lisp, etc...)
>> >> Course Folders (i.e. 6.0001, 6.0002, etc...)
>> >> >> Project Files (i.e. ps0, ps1, etc...)

The purpose is to explore more opportunitie with the languages covered in MIT's courses, as well as introducing languages not taught at MIT to do the same thing they teach there.
